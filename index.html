                          Natasha was a pleasure to work with! I worked with Natasha since I was interning - and working at Agents of Discovery 
                          and she took me under her wing and helped me with more complex tasks, and helped me understand our tech stack and the 
                          standards that we followed. She is very knowledgable with UX, back-end and front-end development.

                          I had the pleasure of being in the same program as Natasha at Okanagan College and was consistently impressed by her 
                          dedication to her studies and since graduating, she has only further enhanced her natural ability in the field by taking 
                          advantage of opportunities and the willingness to step out of her comfort zone.
                          In our coursework, Natasha consistently stood out as a top performer, consistently producing high-quality work and showing 
                          a strong aptitude for programming and problem-solving. She was a valuable asset in group projects, contributing valuable 
                          insights and ideas, always willing to go the extra mile to ensure the success of the project.
                          I have no doubt that Natasha will be an asset to any team or organization and would highly recommend her for any opportunity.
